# The Python Path

## Project Overview

The Python Path is a web-based resource focused on teaching the Python programming language, aimed at anyone interested in programming, technology, and computer science. It is a platform with a dynamic approach, where knowledge is delivered through a structured and guided Learning Plan, designed to make learning Python feel like a true adventure.

The Python Path integrates educational content, examples, tips, notes, and hands-on exercises, with the ability to run Python code directly in the web browser thanks to Pyodide, allowing users to practice comfortably within a complete and interactive learning environment.

Additionally, do you think you are capable of facing the challenge of the Python Serpent? Play and learn, earn points, and put your knowledge to the test while having fun.

Because learning is an adventure!

## Learning Roadmap – The Python Path

- [Python Learning Roadmap](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/roadmap.html#roadmap/)

  - [1. Fundamentals of the Language](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/roadmap.html#module1)

    In this module, you will learn what Python is and how to create your first programs. You will learn how to display text, use variables, work with numbers and strings, perform basic operations, and interact with the user through data input.
    
    - [1.1. What is Python and How Does It Work?](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit1)

      Introduction to the language, its features, readable syntax, and its uses.

    - [1.2. Your First Program: print()](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit2)

      How to display text on the screen and understand the basic structure of a program.
    
    - [1.3. Comments and Basic Code Style](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit3)
      
      Using # to document code and keep it readable.

    - [1.4. Variables and Basic Data Types](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit4)
      
      What variables are, how to create them, and the most common types: int, float, str, bool.

    - [1.5. Mathematical and Text Operations](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit5)
      
      Using +, -, *, / operators, string concatenation, and repetition.

    - [1.6. Data Input With input()](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit6)

      How to receive information from the user and process it.
  
  - [2. Flow Control](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/roadmap.html#module2)

    In this module, you will learn how to control the flow of your program. You will use conditionals to make decisions, loops to repeat actions, and logical operators to combine conditions. You will also learn how to break or continue loops according to your program’s logic.

    - [2.1. Conditionals: if, elif, else](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module2-learning-unit1)

      In this unit, you will learn how to allow your program to make decisions using if, elif, and else, so that the code can execute different actions depending on which conditions are met. You will see how the flow behaves when a condition is true, what happens when none match, and how to chain multiple options together.
    
    - [2.2 Logical and Comparison Operators](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module2-learning-unit2)

      Here you will understand how operators such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= work, and how to combine them with and, or and not to build more complex conditions. This will allow you to evaluate multiple situations at the same time and create more precise decisions within your conditional structures.
    
    - [2.3. while and for Loops](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module2-learning-unit3)

      In this unit, you will learn how to repeat instructions using while and for, which allows you to perform tasks repeatedly without writing the same code many times. You will also learn how to iterate over a sequence of characters (str).
    
    - [2.4. Flow Control in Loops](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module2-learning-unit4)

      Here you will discover how to modify the internal execution of a loop using special statements like break to stop it early, continue to skip a specific iteration, and pass to leave an empty block to be completed later. These tools allow you to have more precise and flexible control over the behavior of your loops.
