# The Python Path

## Project Overview

The Python Path is a web-based resource focused on teaching the Python programming language, aimed at anyone interested in programming, technology, and computer science. It is a platform with a dynamic approach, where knowledge is delivered through a structured and guided Learning Plan, designed to make learning Python feel like a true adventure.

The Python Path integrates educational content, examples, tips, notes, and hands-on exercises, with the ability to run Python code directly in the web browser thanks to Pyodide, allowing users to practice comfortably within a complete and interactive learning environment.

Additionally, do you think you are capable of facing the challenge of the Python Serpent? Play and learn, earn points, and put your knowledge to the test while having fun.

Because learning is an adventure!

## Learning Roadmap – The Python Path

- [Python Learning Roadmap](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/roadmap.html#roadmap/)

  - [1. Fundamentals of the Language](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/roadmap.html#module1)

    In this module, you will learn what Python is and how to create your first programs. You will learn how to display text, use variables, work with numbers and strings, perform basic operations, and interact with the user through data input.
    
    - [1.1. What is Python and How Does It Work?](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit1)

      Introduction to the language, its features, readable syntax, and its uses.

    - [1.2. Your First Program: print()](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit2)

      How to display text on the screen and understand the basic structure of a program.
    
    - [1.3. Comments and Basic Code Style](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit3)
      
      Using # to document code and keep it readable.

    - [1.4. Variables and Basic Data Types](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit4)
      
      What variables are, how to create them, and the most common types: int, float, str, bool.

    - [1.5. Mathematical and Text Operations](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit5)
      
      Using +, -, *, / operators, string concatenation, and repetition.

    - [1.6. Data Input With input()](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/learning-unit.html#module1-learning-unit6)

      How to receive information from the user and process it.
  
  - [2. Flow Control](https://daniel555as.github.io/the-python-path/pages/roadmap.html#module2)
